# Generated Behavior Trees

This directory contains behavior trees generated by the AI agent (Claude).

## About This Directory

- **Purpose**: Store agent-generated BT Python files
- **Gitignored**: Yes (this directory is excluded from version control)
- **Cleanup**: Feel free to delete generated BTs as needed

## Usage

When Claude generates a behavior tree, it will be saved here with a descriptive filename (e.g., `draw_pentagon_2024_12_10.py`).

To execute a generated BT:
```bash
python execution/run_bt.py generated_bts/your_bt_name.py
```

## Safety Note

Always review generated behavior trees before executing them on real hardware. For this prototype, we're using Turtlesim which is safe for experimentation.
